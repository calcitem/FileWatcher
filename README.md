Before starting monitoring, you can specify the file type in the toolbar and specify whether to monitor subdirectories and the scope of monitoring in the program menu, including modification, creation, deletion, and renaming of files or directories. Note: Once you have specified a monitoring type, these options cannot be modified during monitoring.

If the directory is in the monitored state, all changes in the directory that meet the specified conditions will be captured. The event list on the right shows the most recently changed events, and the frequency of updating events is determined by the "Update Frequency" option in the menu. "High", "Medium", and "Low" mean refresh once every 1, 5, and 10 seconds, respectively.

# Supplementary explanation

Standard file system operations may raise several events. For example, when a file is moved from one directory to another, several "change" and some "create" and "delete" events may be raised. Moving a file is a complex operation consisting of several simple functions and thus raises several events. Also, some applications, such as anti-virus software, can cause additional file system events detected by File System Monitor.

The file system monitor can monitor disks if they are not switched or removed. Because the timestamps and attributes of CDs and DVDs cannot be changed, the File System Monitor does not raise events for CDs and DVDs.
